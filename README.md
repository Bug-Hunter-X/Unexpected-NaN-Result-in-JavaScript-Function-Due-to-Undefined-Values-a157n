This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error where a function doesn't explicitly handle undefined values, leading to unexpected NaN (Not a Number) results.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous function, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that gracefully handles both null and undefined inputs.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling and input validation in JavaScript functions.
